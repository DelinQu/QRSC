This repository contains the code for the paper Towards Nonlinear-Motion-Aware and Occlusion-Robust Rolling Shutter Correction, a geometry-based quadratic rolling shutter motion solver that precisely estimates the high-order correction field of individual pixels and a self-alignment 3D video architecture $RSA^2$-Net for high-quality frame aggregation and synthesis against extreme scene occlusion.

## Update

- [x] Project Pages for Towards Nonlinear-Motion-Aware and Occlusion-Robust Rolling Shutter Correction [2023-8-16]
- [x] Youtube video for Towards Nonlinear-Motion-Aware and Occlusion-Robust Rolling Shutter Correction [2023-8-16]

## Installation
- Note ðŸ“¢: We do not provide checkpoints due to the time schedule in the master branch, but you can find checkpoints and old version code in [commit_e9a9](https://github.com/DelinQu/QRSC/tree/8739072e3c848cbc832d0f30d998e2d41b51e9a9).
Please follow the instructions below to install the repo and dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DelinQu/QRSC.git
cd QRSC
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install the environment

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n qrsc python=3.9.12
conda activate qrsc

# Install all the dependencies via pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build extensions: LPIPS and package_core for evaluation
cd src/lib
bash install.sh
```

### Install MMFlow
Please refer to the [installation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmflow/blob/master/docs/en/install.md) for optical flow support. After that, please download the RAFT and GMA model by:
```bash
mim download mmflow --config gma_plus-p_8x2_120k_mixed_368x768
mim download mmflow --config raft_8x2_100k_mixed_368x768
```

The model will be automatically downloaded at $HOME/.cache

## Dataset
Plase follow [DeepUnrollNet](https://github.com/ethliup/DeepUnrollNet) and [BSRSC](https://github.com/ljzycmd/BSRSC) to download the Carla-RS, Fastec-RS and BSRSC datasets. The update the dataset [configurations](conf/dataset):
```yaml
# @package data_loader
_target_: src.dataset.Carla.get_data_loaders
train_dir: path_to_carla_train
val_dir: path_to_carla_val
test_dir: path_to_carla_test
batch_size: ${batch_size}
seq_len: ${arch.n_inputs}
load_mask: true
training: true
shuffle: true
num_workers: ${n_cpu}
load_middle_gs: true

data_aug: 
  _target_: src.dataset.transforms.ToTensor
```

## Evaluation
The [script](run_test.sh) provides evaluation methods of all the three datasets. Before run the following code, please [download the checkpoints]() to the [checkpoint dir](checkpoint).

```bash
bash run_test.sh
```

## Traning
We provides the training [scripts](run.sh) on all the three datasets.
```bash
bash run_test.sh
```

## Acknowledgement
